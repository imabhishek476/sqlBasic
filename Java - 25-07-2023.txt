IN java programming language is possible bcz of predefined class known as Scanner


how to read input from the user
step 1: import the scanner class in program syntax is :

lang package is default package of java that is used by compiler


import java.packageName.ClassName; 
class Test{
public static void main(String []args){
}
}



Step 2 : in order to use second class data in methods we have to create of scanner class then only access data or methods of scanner class
Note: because all methods are non- static type



Object Area :

syntax : (ClassName or non- primitiva data type)  (reference Variable) =  (new Keyword) Constructor(argument);

                         Scanner s = new Scanner(system.in);




import java.packageName.ClassName; 
class Test{
public static void main(String []args){
Scanner s = new Scanner(system.in);
int a = s.nextInt();
int b = s.nextInt();
System.out.println(a + b);

}
}
