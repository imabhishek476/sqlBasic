Unicode  vs   ASCII:-


Variables:
It is a concept which act as container that used to store value. A variable can store any type of value(primitiva and non)
we can change a variable value any time through out the program. When ever we change and update the value of variable then it gets updated at memory location

Declaration of variable:
The process of providing the name of the container variable with his data type is known as varible
Syntax is : 


Intializtion of variable:
providing the value to already declared variable is known as intianlisation


Note: we can declare and intialize in a single line
syntax is : Datatype  variable_nake  = value;
for example: int age = 24;

we can follow a single line approach when we know the variable value in advanced
