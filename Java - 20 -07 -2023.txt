Assignment operator:
 ( = ) symbol is used as a assign ment operator. is used to assign a value in a container. it works right hand to left hand side
Syntax : var-name/container = value/operation.

Increment operator:
In java ++ symbol is used to represent increment operator. It is used to increase a variable value by 1. 
There are 2 types of increment operator. 1) Pre-Increment Operator     2)Post- Increment operator

Pre-Increment Operator:
if we prefix increment operator before varaible then such operation is known as pre increment.
In preincrement first value gets updated at memory location then only it going to display
for ex: int i = 13;  Sop(++i);   


Post- Increment operator:
If increment operator is suffix with variable name then such operation is known as post increment. In post increment first value gets displayed then only it will updated at memory location.
for ex: int i = 13;  Sop(i++);


decrement operator: ( --n , n--)             2 types : pre and post
