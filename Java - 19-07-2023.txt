operators are divided on the basis their task and number of operands.

Arithmatic operators:
are the binary operators that meets 2 values or operands to perform the task. are used to perform maths calculations 
with different kind of values. ( + , - , * , /, %)



'+' symbol:
case 1 : if both the values or operand of plus symbol are of numeric type then plus symbol act as addition operator.
         for ex: 10 + 20 = 30      5.0 + 2 = 7.0

case 2 : if any of the operand of plus symbol is string type then plus symbol act as concatination operator
