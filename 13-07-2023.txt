Literals:
Literals are...
Such information or values or data or inputs are known as literals.
There are 2 types of literals- a) single value literals and b) multi-value literals

Single Value literals known as primitive value.
Multi Value literal known as non-primitive value.

Single value Literals:- Numeric Literals value , Boolean Literals values, Character Literals
Multi Value literal :-  String, ArrayList, LInkedList< Vector, hashSet , Every class &Object are Multi-value


Data Types:
is a concept that categories data according to their types and size.
Data types help usto create a specific type of container to store different kind of data
There are 2 types of of data types :-  Primitive data types , Non-Primitive data types


Non-Primitive data types:
it represent multi- value data . every class in java is a non- primitive data types either a class is 
pre-defines or user defined


Primitive Data types:
are used to represent primitive values(single value literals). There are 8 pre-defined primitive data types present in the form of keywords




1 bytes = 8 bits;
1 bytes = 2^ no. of bits
          2^8 => 256 values


formula to find out the range of data types ==> (-2^ no. of bits-1)   to    (2^no of bits-1)
